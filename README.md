mixcrib
=======

A webapp that allows you to combine playlists and tracks from multiple sources like Youtube and Soundcloud and play it all in your browser. If you're like me and listen to music in multiple services, you will find this useful.

Live Demo at: http://rahij.com/projects/mixcrib

Currently Supported:

- Soundcloud:
    - Sets like https://soundcloud.com/pha-5/sets/deep-house-1/
- Youtube:
    - Playlists like http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB916CD1F8E94AE3C
    - Videos like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcrbM1l_BoI

As you can see, this is a very bare bones app, limited in functionality. Here is the intial roadmap of the things I want to do in the short term:

 - Persisting of playlists created in a database (probably without user accounts and just a unique URL for a start)
 - Restructure the webapp in Backbone, it is currently a less horrible sphagetti JS mess
 - Support for Soundcloud tracks too and Spotify, iTunes
 - Search for media directly from the app
 - Support for local MP3s (not sure if people still do this, but I sometimes do)
